# Emerson-Agile-Software-Development-Technical-Assessment

Overview
----------

This website was created as a take home assignment for the Emerson Agile Software Development Assessment. The wesbsite is a weather application that has a search bar to search by city name or city name and country to search for current weather conditions pulled from the https://openweathermap.org/api .

Features
----------

I was given the task to create a web application where a user can search by city name, zip code, or geo location. I chose to have the user search by city name, so the user is able to search by city name and/or the country code with a comma and a space after the city name. For search examples, please see below:

Olivette

or 

Olivette, USA

How I plan to improve the application
---------------------------------------------

- Add an alert to inform users of when they search for a city name that is not valid, pulling from the 404 error that gets sent to the console.
- Create a dropdown to show a list of all cities, states, and zipcodes when a user searches for a common city like 'Springfield,' so that the user can choose the Springfield that applies to them.
- Populate information such as wind speed, humidity percentage and percipitation percentage.
- Create tests to test that the code is running smoothly.
